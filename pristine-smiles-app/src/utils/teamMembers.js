                    <b>Hi, I'm Dr. Pooja Lama — and I'm here to help you smile with confidence.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve always believed that going to the dentist shouldn’t be stressful — it should be comfortable, personal, 
                    and even a little fun! I started this practice to create a welcoming space where patients of all ages feel heard, 
                    cared for, and truly understood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve been practicing for over 25 years. Along the way, I’ve developed a special interest in cosmetic dentistry, 
                    Invisalign, gentle family care, etc. and I love helping people feel great about their smiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you're here for a simple cleaning, a smile makeover, or anything in between, my team and I are committed to 
                    making your visit smooth and stress-free. We take the time to explain everything, answer your questions, and make 
                    sure you leave with a smile — every time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not in the office, you’ll find me reading, trying out new recipes, spending time with my kids, exploring the outdoors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for stopping by — I can’t wait to meet you!
